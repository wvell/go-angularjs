go-angularjs
------------
A wrapper for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) to be used with [GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

## Project status
Angularjs is being used less and there are better/newer alternatives that should be used. The support for angularjs will stop on December 31, 2021(https://docs.angularjs.org/misc/version-support-status).

Therefore this project is archived and will not be maintained anymore.

## Examples
Run the examples in the example directory with `gopherjs serve`.
